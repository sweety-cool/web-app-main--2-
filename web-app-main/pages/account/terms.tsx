The term “Machinist” is used in this Agreement to represent parts machining service providers who seek assignments and complete projects posted by Customers.</p>

                    <h5>4. SERVICES</h5>

                    <p>Usineur.fr provides services to both Clients and Machinists.

                        (i) Usineur.fr facilitates contact between Customers and Usineurs by offering a system for publishing projects and offers. We do not control the exchanges taking place between Customers and Machinists. Consequently, we do not define and we are not responsible for the price, quality and conformity of the machining services provided by the Machinists, the confidentiality clauses, the transfer of intellectual property, the conformity or legality of the calls for offers submitted, the ability of Customers to publish announcements, or the ability of Machinists to respond and carry out the projects described in these announcements. We cannot and do not control Customers' ability to make payment. We are not responsible for transactions and/or contacts,<br />

                        It is strictly forbidden to publish contact information or to solicit this information in the description of a project, in the profile of a Registered User, in any offer issued by a Machinist, in the messages sent by the Machinist between the when the Machinist was selected and when the funds were paid by the Client.<br />

                        It is strictly forbidden for the Machinist to offer, request or agree to receive payment outside the Usineur.fr payment system from a Client met on Usineur.fr. This is valid for all orders and for all relations between a customer and a Machinist for a period of 24 months after the first contact between the two parties.<br />


                        (ii) To facilitate the realization of a project, its delivery and its payment, Usineur.fr offers a set of tools allowing Customers and Usineurs to communicate about the project in particular through:<br />

                        - private messaging Usineur.fr -<br />
                        payment<br />
                        - evaluation<br />

                        finalized and cannot be modified.
                        <br />
                        (iii) Usineur.fr offers a security deposit service (also called deposit of funds). By using the security deposit service, the Customer and the Usineur mandate Usineur.fr to transfer to the Usineur the payment made by the Customer to pay for the service. The Customer and the Usineur mandate Usineur.fr to keep the payment blocked until the service is delivered by the Usineur to the Customer. The Client informs the Machinist to release the blocked payment once the service has been delivered in good and due form by the Machinist and the Client has approved that the service meets the specifications mentioned in the advertisement.
                        Payment for the service is transferred by Usineur.fr to the Usineur if:
                        - the Customer has made payment to Usineur.fr without default of payment
                        - the Client has validated the transfer of payment to the Machinist.
                        The site will receive the payment and place the amount on hold until the project is validated by Client. This process is called “Secure Payment with Security Deposit”. We will keep these funds, called “Cash on Deposit” until the Client validates the Project (the Project has actually been delivered and the Quality is approved). You understand that funds on deposit will be held among other funds on deposit from other Users. Usineur.fr guarantees the funds deposited in secure accounts. After the Customer has approved the service, we will, at your request, make the Final Payment to the Machinist from the Deposit Money previously deposited by you.
                        <br />
                        (iv) In the event of a dispute, the Client and the Machinist undertake to continue their exchanges and to negotiate between them by all possible legal means to find an amicable solution to their dispute. They undertake to find a solution for the realization of the work, the delivery, the payment and the evaluation of the other party. If no amicable agreement has been found within 15 calendar days after a problem has been reported by the Client or the Usineur to Usineur.fr at the address admin@usineur.fr, Usineur.fr or another intermediary whose the choice will be made by Usineur.fr at its sole discretion, may become the arbiter of a dispute between the Client and the Usineur. The resolution of the dispute will include appealing the content of the original advertisement, the offer issued by the Machinist, amendments or related communications that have taken place through the Website. If one of the 2 parties is not available to respond to the other or to Usineur.fr, it must imperatively indicate this as soon as it becomes aware of it and at the latest 15 days before it is not available so that if a dispute arises, she can offer solutions before she is no longer available.
                        <br />
                        (v) Usineur.fr will honestly interpret the project according to the dispute between the Client and the Usineur. To render its decision, Usineur.fr takes into account only: the project as described on the website, the causes of the dispute from the point of view of both parties, the traces of activity as well as the communications through the Website, the project itself and any other information and communications that Registered Users agree to disclose as part of the Dispute Resolution Service.<br />

                        (vi) You agree that the decision of Usineur.fr, acting as arbitrator during the Dispute Resolution Service, is final, binding and concerns both Parties. Accordingly, after we have rendered our decision, we will proceed with the disbursement of all or part of the money placed in the Deposit Service in accordance with our judgment. If our decision involves the refund of your payment placed in the Security Deposit Service, you accept and understand that a charge corresponding to the transfer costs of this money will be deducted from this sum.<br />

                        (vii) In the event that you are the losing party in this arbitration, you agree not to benefit from the decision in question, in any form whatsoever. By registering as a user, you accept Usineur.fr's arbitration.<br />

                        (viii) By clicking on the "REGISTER" box of this Agreement, you understand that in consideration of this Agreement to provide you with the services of Filing and resolution of Disputes, you release Usineur.fr from all damages or liabilities related your commitment to a Machinist or Customer or our services, including without limitation, the Filing Service and the Dispute Resolution Service.<br />

                    <h5>7. PARTY RELATIONSHIP AND OBLIGATION</h5>

                    <p>A. Usineur.fr provides CONNECTION Services for Registered Users, including Customers and Machinists. All parties are independent of Usineur.fr with respect to matters dealt with outside of this Agreement. Registered Users should not be considered as employees, agents or partners of Usineur.fr and Usineur.fr should not be considered as an employer, agent, or partner of Registered Users.

                        B. You understand that Usineur.fr merely acts as an intermediary between Customers and Usineurs, and provides you with a Payment service.

                        B. Commissions are paid by the Machinist.

To avoid any abuse, you understand and accept that the reimbursement of a commission may be made exclusively in the form of a credit note and not a reimbursement in cash.</p>
