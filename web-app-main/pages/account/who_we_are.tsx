                    <p>Usineur.fr was born in June 2013 from our machining experience. Having noted the significant variations in prices offered for the same part and the large number of customers renouncing to place an order because of high prices, we took the initiative to create a site on which buyers and machinists can easily find each other.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the machining costs depend on the type of machining to be carried out but also on the equipment of the machining workshop, the know-how of the machinist and the raw materials in stock in the workshop.</p>
                    <p>Thus, for the same machining job, the costs can vary significantly from one workshop to another. By making it possible to broadcast machining advertisements to numerous machinists, Usineur.fr enables machinists to identify the requests that best correspond to their capacity. And companies and individuals to access machine shops that will best meet their specific needs.</p>
                    <p>By offering a meeting place specializing in machining between customers and machinists, we will facilitate access to machining for as many people as possible and thus enable machine shops to fully express their potential.</p>
